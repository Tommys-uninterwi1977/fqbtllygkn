Oh man, where do I even start with When Life Gives You Tangerines? Like, you ever watch something and just think, “Did I really just see that?” I mean, seriously, that’s what happened with this one. Can't believe I didn't just download the movie sooner! It's got everything from moments that make you go “whoa” to “wait, what just happened?” I swear, I'm still processing it.

I was so hyped at the beginning — like it sucked me in, you know? But then halfway through I’m kinda lost, like the plot took a left turn and didn't tell me. Or maybe I zoned out a little, lol. Anyway, there’s this scene where I’m just like, is this even real? It’s emotional whiplash with some goofy chuckles thrown in. It’s like they couldn’t decide if they wanted to be deep or just funny. Or maybe they wanted both, who knows?

> There’s this one character, Sarah or Sloane or something — seriously, give her an Oscar. Or maybe a box of tangerines, lol. She’s all over the place, but that’s what makes her kind of fascinating. You think she’s gonna do one thing, but nope, flips the script on you. Keeps grinding like it’s nothing, even when it makes zero sense.

Oh, and get this, I’m watching the movie, right? And my cat just pops onto my lap like it’s trying to figure out why I’m laughing and questioning my life choices. Guess we were both confused after that crazy ending. It’s just one of those films that’s either genius, or total chaos walking hand-in-hand with genius. Not sure which yet.

In the end, I guess it was worth it — the whole rollercoaster emotion thing. Kinda bizarre, somewhat hilarious. Makes you think, but not too hard, which I’m all for. For real though, if you ever get spare time, give it a shot, or maybe just watch it if it ever pops up in your suggestions. Who knew life would hand me a bowl of tangerines, and now I can't stop thinking about them. 🍊
